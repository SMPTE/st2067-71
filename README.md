## Details

This standard, along with ST 2117-10, enable the development of IMF and MXF workflows, respectively, utilizing VC-6 video compression.

SMPTE ST 2117-1 VC-6 Multiplanar Picture Format - Part 1 Elementary Bitstream defines an innovative, mezzanine codec that provides multi-resolution lossless and lossy encoding modes and has been designed for efficient implementation on CPUs and GPUs. Its hierarchical approach allows easy access to lower resolution proxies and regions of interest which can significantly reduce storage costs and simplify the implementation of de-centralized, cloud-based workflows particularly when coupled with the versioning functionality of the Interoperable Mastering Format, IMF.

V-Nova, one of the main proponents of the VC-6 standard, are keen to work with companies to develop workflows that exploit the resolution versatility of VC-6 coupled with the timeline versatility of IMF to create open, standards-based applications that bring high quality at low cost.
